Sankey chart is an effective tool to show the flow of data from one direction (sources) to another direction (targets).  

I have used the 2020 refugee data from UNHCR to create a sankey chart in Tableau Public.  However, I know that the r package  
networkD3 can create a sankey chart as well.  Therefore, I would like to try it and see how the sankey chart looks like.  
Will it be the same as the one I create in Tableau? Which one will be easier to use?  

Eventually, I found it is easier to create a sankey chart by using R.  Also, it is possible to turn the result into  
an interactive chart with Shiny.  However, the look of the chart is different from the tableau version.
